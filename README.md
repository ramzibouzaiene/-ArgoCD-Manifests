I successfully deployed the application using Argo CD by carefully following a structured approach to manage and apply Kubernetes configurations. First, I created the repository and i added the necessary YAML files for the deployment, service and application configurations. The repository included deployment manifests for both the frontend and backend applications. I then applied these configurations to my Kubernetes cluster using kubectl apply, which created the necessary resources in the cluster.

Through this process, I achieved a successful deployment using Argo CD, leveraging its capabilities for GitOps-based continuous deployment and ensuring smooth operation and management of the application within the Kubernetes environment.
